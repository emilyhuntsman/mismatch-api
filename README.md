# mismatch-api

pipenv run python3 manage.py runserver (to run server locally)

This project allowed me to work in a new backend framework, Django, which I've grown to love. It provides my website (mismatch.com) with api endpoints for would you rather style questions as well as user authentication through JWT. The underlying database is Postgres, and the site is hosted on Heroku, so it can be a little slow to wake up at times. I really enjoyed all of the built in functionality of Django, although the learning curve was a little steep.
